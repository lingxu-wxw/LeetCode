// Input: current = "02:30", correct = "04:35"
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// We can convert current to correct in 3 operations as follows:
// - Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes "03:30".
// - Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes "04:30".
// - Add 5 minutes to current. current becomes "04:35".
// It can be proven that it is not possible to convert current to correct in fewer than 3 operations.
