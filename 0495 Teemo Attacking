// Input: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
// - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
// - At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
// Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.
